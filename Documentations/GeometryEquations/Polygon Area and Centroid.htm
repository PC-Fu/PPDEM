<b>Area</b>

</p><p align="justify">
The problem of determining the area of a polygon seems at best messy but the
final formula is particularly simple. The result and sample source code (C)
will be presented here.
Consider a polygon made up of line segments between N vertices 
(x<sub>i</sub>,y<sub>i</sub>), i=0 to
N-1. The last vertex 
(x<sub>N</sub>,y<sub>N</sub>) is assumed to be the same as the first, ie: the
polygon is closed.

</p><p align="justify">
Note for polygons with holes. The holes are usually defined by ordering the
vertices of the enclosing polygon in the opposite direction to those of the
holes. This algorithm still works except that the absolute value should be
taken after adding the polygon area to the area of all the holes. That is, the
holes areas will be of opposite sign to the bounding polygon area.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The sign of the area expression above (without the absolute value) can be 
used to determine the ordering of the vertices of the polygon. If the 
sign is positive then the polygon vertices are ordered counter clockwise 
about the normal, otherwise clockwise. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
To derive this solution, project lines from each vertex to some horizontal line
below the lowest part of the polygon. The enclosed region from each line
segment is made up of a triangle and rectangle. Sum these areas together noting
that the areas outside the polygon eventually cancel as the polygon loops
around to the beginning.

</p><p align="justify">
The only restriction that will be placed on the polygon for this 
technique to work is that the polygon must not be self intersecting, 
for example the solution will fail in the following cases.

<b>Centroid</b>

</p><p align="justify">
The centroid is also known as the "centre of gravity" or the "center
of mass". The position of the centroid assuming the polygon to be made
of a material of uniform density is given below. As in the calculation
of the area above, x<sub>N</sub> is assumed to be x<sub>0</sub>, in
other words the polygon is closed.

<b>Centroid of a 3D shell described by 3 vertex facets</b></p><p>
</p><p align="justify">
The centroid C of a 3D object made up of a collection of N triangular
faces with vertices (a<sub>i</sub>,b<sub>i</sub>,c<sub>i</sub>)
is given below. R<sub>i</sub> is the average of the vertices of
the i'th face and A<sub>i</sub> is twice the area of the i'th face.
Note the faces are assumed to be thin sheets of uniform mass,
they need not be connected or form a solid object. This reduces
to the equations above for a 2D 3 vertex polygon.
