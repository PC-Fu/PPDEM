      <b>I. Overview</b></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the last section we derived the 
      stress equilibrium equations based on considerations of force balance within 
      the material. The stress equilibrium equations, although derived for the 
      <i>deformed</i> state of that material, did not entail any assumptions about 
      the material or the type of deformation it encurs. We learned that for most 
      situations, the stress equilibrium equations are indeterminate, and we can't 
      solve for material stresses directly from these equations. We therefore 
      need to consider other aspects of the material and tissue mechanics. The 
      next logical step is to examine then how the material deforms. It is at 
      this point that we introduce our first significant assumptions concerning 
      continuum mechanics. If we make no assumptions about the size of deformation, 
      then the resulting strain tensor is valid for every situation. However, 
      this strain tensor is nonlinear and leads to complex analysis. Therefore, 
      if the deformation is small (typically less than 3-4%), then we can use 
      a small deformation analysis, which is linear and simpler to use. In tissue 
      mechanics, hard tissues fit under the small deformation model, but most 
      soft tissues typically undergo large deformation (strains &gt; 5%). In this 
      section, we will discuss and derive deformation and strain measures for 
      both small and large deformation. By the end of this section, you should 
      be able to:</p>
    <p>1. Understand concepts of the small deformation tensor<br>
      2. Understand concepts of initial and deformed configuration<br>
      3. Understand the concept of displacement<br>
      4. Understand the concept of the deformation gradient tensor<br>
      5. Understand the concept of the large deformation strain tensor<br>
      6. Understand differences between small and large deformation</p>
    <p><b>II. Small Deformation Strain Tensor</b></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We first consider the case of small 
      deformation, since this is applicable to bone and is much less complex than 
      large deformation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider the deformation 
      of an infinitesimal cube (once more!) in the x1 direction:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/def1.jpg" height="217" width="344"></p>
    <p>We know that if the displacements are small, then we can approximate the 
      normal strain in the 11 direction as:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq1.gif" height="73" width="118"> </p>
    <p>If we in the limit allow both <img src="bme456straindef_files/Delx1eq.htm" align="top" height="25" width="32">and 
      <img src="bme456straindef_files/delu1.gif" align="top" height="25" width="30"> both to approach 
      zero, then we arrive at the following <i>strain displacement</i> relationship:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/strain11.gif" height="52" width="77"></p>
    <p>This corresponds to our notion that strain is defined as the change in 
      length over length. Note that this is an approximation of strain for small 
      deformations. Thus, it is our definition of strain that renders this discussion 
      for the <i>small deformation</i> part of small deformation elasticity. We 
      can also do the same change in length for the x2 and x3 directions to arrive 
      at:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="norstrain"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/strain2233.gif" height="108" width="82"></p>
    <p>Next, let us consider a pure shear deformation as shown as the infinitesimal 
      cube below:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/sheardef1.jpg" height="241" width="321"></p>
    <p>Here, the total deformation is the sum of the angles <font face="Symbol">q</font>1 
      and <font face="Symbol">q</font>2, and can be written as:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="angdef"></a>&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/shearang.gif" height="46" width="172"></p>
    <p>Note that <font face="Symbol">q</font>1 is defined to <i>equal</i> <font face="Symbol">q</font>2,<font face="Symbol">q</font>1 
      = <font face="Symbol">q</font>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we use some trigonometry. 
      We note that the tangent of <font face="Symbol">q</font>1 and the tangent 
      of &nbsp;<font face="Symbol">q</font>2 can be written as:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/sineang.gif" height="105" width="100"></p>
    <p>If we assume that the angle of deformation is small (again referring back 
      that this section is <i>small deformation</i> strain), we know that the 
      tangent of a small angle is equivalent to the angle itself, assuming we 
      define the angle in radians. Thus, we may write the above as:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/sineang2.gif" height="105" width="246"> 
    </p>
    <p>We can thus rewrite the <a href="#angdef">angular deformation from above</a> 
      as:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/shearstrain1.gif" height="57" width="329"></p>
    <p>Note that we have added an extra definition <font face="Symbol">e</font>12. 
      This is the definition of <i>tensorial</i> shear strain that is one half 
      <font face="Symbol">g</font>12 that is the definiton of <i>engineering</i> 
      shear strain. If we taken the limit as all delta quantities go to zero, 
      then we have the following definition of the shear strain:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/shearstrain2.gif" height="57" width="225"></p>
    <p>by definition shear strains are symmetric as we see below:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/shearstrain3.gif" height="57" width="442"></p>
    <p>The definition of the other shear strains follows directly as:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/shearstrain4.gif" height="238" width="169"></p>
    <p>Given the <a href="#norstrain">definition of normal strains</a>, and the 
      shear strains given above, we can write a compact defintion of small strain 
      in indicial notation as:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="straindef"></a><img src="bme456straindef_files/strainind.gif" height="62" width="164"></p>
    <p>Note that the small deformation strain is a second order tensor just like 
      the Cauchy stress tensor. It has nine components for 3D. We can write the 
      small deformation strain tensor in matrix form as:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq2.gif" height="572" width="813"><a name="straindisp"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>How does the addition of the strain displacement relationship affect our 
      ability to solve the mechanics problem. Well, now we have introduced 12 
      more unknowns, the nine strains eij and the three displacements ui. We have 
      introduced, however, only 9 additional equations, <a href="#straindisp">namely 
      the strain-displacement equations</a>. </p>
    <p><b>III. Definition of Reference and Deformed Configurations, and the Relationships 
      between Them</b></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We explicitly made the assumption in 
      deriving the small strain tensor that strains were "small" for 
      both normal and shear strain. While this assumption is valid for bone, it 
      is not valid for soft tissues. Of course, one may ask why bother with assuming 
      small deformation at all. As we will see in this section, large deformation, 
      while valid for all deformation situations, is much more complex and introduces 
      nonlinearity into the problem, called <i>geometric nonlinearity</i>. </p>
    <p>III.A. Reference (Initial) and Deformed Configurations</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 
      first step in defining large deformation strain measures is to define the 
      relationship between what is known as the <i>reference, initial or undeformed</i> 
      configuration of a body, and the <i>deformed</i> configuration of the body. 
      The <i>reference or undeformed</i> configuation is the condition of the 
      body in 3D space before loads have been applied to it. The <i>deformed</i> 
      configuration is the location and shape of the body after loads have been 
      applied to it. It is important to note that the body may undergo rigid body 
      motion in addition to strain when loades are placed on it. An illustration 
      of the relationship between the initial (note that I will use <i>initial</i>, 
      <i>reference</i>, and <i>undeformed</i> configuration interchangeably throughout 
      this section) and deformed configuration is shown below:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/pot1.jpg" height="252" width="548"></p>
    <p>III.B. Displacement: Relationship between a point in the Reference and 
      Deformed Configuration</p>
    <p>Note that we have defined a vector in 3D space x' in the reference configuration 
      of the body and a vector x in the deformed configuration of the body. We 
      note that the relationship between the two position vectors in space, which 
      represent the locations of a point in the reference configuration and a 
      point in the deformed configuration, is the <i>displacement</i> vector, 
      as shown below:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/pot2.jpg" height="252" width="548"></p>
    <p>By vector addition, we can directly write the relationship between the 
      position vectors in the initial and deformed configuration:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="dispeq"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/eq1.gif" height="32" width="90"></p>
    <p>III.C. Deformation Gradient: Relationship between a material vector in 
      the Reference and Deformed Configuration</p>
    <p>The above results tells us how a point displaces from the reference to 
      the deformed configuration. However, we would also like to know how a piece 
      of material, again, an infinitesimal piece, is stretched and rotated as 
      the body moves from the reference to the deformed configuration. The infinitesimal 
      material vector in the reference configuration, dx', is shown in red in 
      the reference configuration. The material vector after it has been stretched 
      and rotated, dx, is shown in red in the deformed configuration below:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/defgrad1.jpg" height="282" width="592"><a name="materialvector"></a></p>
    <p>Since the length of dx' can change when going to the deformed configuration 
      as well as its orientation, we can say that dx' deforms into dx. The question 
      then becomes how to relate dx in the deformed configuration into dx' of 
      the reference configuration. This can readily be done through the chain 
      rule as:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="defgrad"></a>&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/eq2.gif" height="58" width="114"></p>
    <p>The above equation gives a relationship between a material vector in the 
      undeformed and deformed configuration. We define the mapping itself as the 
      deformation gradient tensor:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/eq3.gif" height="58" width="76">.</p>
    <p>where Fij is the deformation gradient tensor. We know by the rules of index 
      notation that F is a second order tensor, since it has two independent indices. 
      It is also important to note that F IS NOT Symmetric. We can also write 
      the deformation gradient tensor in matrix format as:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq3.gif" height="264" width="510"><a name="defgradtensor"></a></p>
    <p>III.D. Relating the Displacement Vector and Deformation Gradient Tensor</p>
    <p>We now have two entities that relate quantities in the reference configuration 
      to the deformed configuration: the displacement vector and the deformation 
      gradient tensor. The next logical question is whether these quantities themselves 
      have any connection. First, let us begin with the displacement vector that 
      relates a position in the reference configuration to a position in the deformed 
      configuration:</p>
    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/eq1.gif" height="32" width="90"></p>
    <p>The above equation actually represents the relationship between the three 
      coordinates in a reference and deformed configuration:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq4.gif" height="141" width="137"></p>
    <p>Now let us differentiate each on of the above equations with repect to 
      <img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq5.gif" align="absmiddle" height="42" width="29">, <img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq6.gif" align="absmiddle" height="42" width="30">, 
      and <img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq7.gif" align="absmiddle" height="42" width="30">:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq8.gif" height="293" width="622"></p>
    <p>Let's first look at and group the left hand side of the differentiated 
      displacement relationship. If we group all these terms, <a href="#defgradtensor">we 
      end up with the deformation gradient tensor</a>. Now, let's take a look 
      at the first term on the right hand side in each of the above equations. 
      If we group these terms in a matrix, we obtain:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq9.gif" height="280" width="213">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Let us look more carefully at each entry in the above matrix. Obviously, 
      if we differentiate something with respect to itself we get 1. Thus, the 
      diagonal of the above matrix will all have ones. For all the off axis terms, 
      we are differentiating a one coordinate position with respect to one of 
      the two other coordinate positions. Since one coordinate position (e.g. 
      1,2,3) does not depend on the other coordinate positions, these terms are 
      all zero. This leaves us with the identity matrix, which is <a href="file:///C%7C/scotthollister/Hollistersite/BME332/mathprelim/bme332mathprelim.htm#dotproductkronecker">equivalent 
      to the kronecker delta 2nd order tensor we defined in the section on mathematical 
      preliminaries</a>:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq10.gif" height="118" width="193">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Finally, we consider the term on the right hand side of the differentiated 
      displacement equation. We can also write this in a matrix from as:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq11.gif" height="264" width="292"></p>
    <p>We can also recognize from the mathematical preliminary section that the 
      above entity is <a href="file:///C%7C/scotthollister/Hollistersite/BME332/mathprelim/bme332mathprelim.htm#gradvector">the 
      gradient of the displacement</a>. We can therefore recognize that differentiating 
      the displacement equation with respect to <img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq5.gif" align="absmiddle" height="42" width="29">, 
      <img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq6.gif" align="absmiddle" height="42" width="30">, and 
      <img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq7.gif" align="absmiddle" height="42" width="30"> gives 
      us the deformation gradient tensor being equal to the kronecker delta second 
      order tensor plus the graident of the displacement. This relationship is 
      written in both matrix and index notation below:</p>
    <p>Matrix Notation:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq12.gif" height="280" width="853"></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Index Notation:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq13.gif" height="92" width="333"></p>
    <p>III E Decomposing the Deformation Gradient Tensor in Stretch and Rotation 
      Tensors</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we noted earlier, the deformation 
      gradient tensor includes both rigid body and deformation modes. Therefore, 
      we should be able to decompose the deformation gradient into rigid body 
      and deformation components. Since translation does not change any vector 
      or its components, we can therefore conclude that the deformation gradient 
      tensor contains only deformation plus rotation components. To verify this, 
      consider pure translation. In this case, we may write directly x in terms 
      of x' plus a translational component:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq50.gif" height="178" width="562"></p>
    <p>If we plug the above translation component into the deformation gradient 
      tensor definition we have:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq51.gif" height="280" width="480"></p>
    <p>In pure translation, all points in the body will move the same amount in 
      each of the three orthogonal directions. This means that s1, s2, and s3 
      will not differ at different points in the body. Thus, the gradients of 
      s1, s2 and s3 with respect to x' will all be zero. This leaves us with the 
      fact that the deformation gradient tensor is the identity under pure translation:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq52.gif" height="118" width="184"></p>
    <p>we also not that when there is no displacement at all the deformation gradient 
      tensor will also be equal to the identity tensor. Thus, the deformation 
      gradient tensor does not distinguish between states of translation.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, we know that the deformation gradient tensor 
      will only contain the rigid body mode of rotation in addition to stretch. 
      We therefore postulate without proof that the deformation gradient tensor 
      can be decomposed into a rotation multipled by stretch or a stretch multiplied 
      by rotation. Let us denote the rotation tensor by R. If we decompose the 
      deformation gradient tensor such that we rotate first and then stretch, 
      we denote this stretch tensor by U. We therefore can write this decomposition 
      as:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq53.gif" height="38" width="148"></p>
    <p>If we first stretch and then rotate, we denote the stretch tensor by V, 
      and can write the decompositon as:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq54.gif" height="38" width="142"></p>
    <p>Graphically, we can represent this decomposition as:</p>
    <p><img src="bme456straindef_files/rotstretch.jpg" height="516" width="744"></p>
    <p>We further note that the rotation tensor has special properties, namely 
      that it is orthogonal. This means that the transpose of the rotation tensor 
      multiplied by itself will give the identity tensor:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq55.gif" height="46" width="261"></p>
    <p>This property will play a role in the definition of other deformation tensors, 
      which themselves play a significant role in definition of many constitutive 
      equations. </p>
    <p><b>IV. Definition of Large Deformation or Finite Strain Tensor and other 
      Deformation Tensors in terms of the Deformation Gradient Tensor</b></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once we have defined reference 
      configuration, deformed configuration, displacement, and deformation gradient 
      tensor, we can derive the large strain tensor. We cannot use the deformation 
      gradient tensor as a strain measure directly because it can contain rigid 
      body modes like translation and rotation. For a strain tensor, our goal 
      is to obtain some measure the change in length of a material. One way to 
      measure length is to take the dot product of the <a href="#materialvector">material 
      vector we used when defining the deformation gradient</a> with itself. Thus, 
      the length squared ds'^2 of the material vector in the reference configuration 
      is:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq14.gif" height="46" width="592"></p>
    <p>We can likewise write the length squared of the material vector ds^2 in 
      the deformed configuration as:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq15.gif" height="46" width="566"></p>
    <p>The strain tensor should be a measure of how much the material vector in 
      the reference configuration is stretched into the deformed configuration. 
      We would essentially like the strain measure to operate on the material 
      vector in the reference configuration and generate the difference in the 
      square of the lengths of the material vector. We may write this idea in 
      compact index notation as:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq16.gif" height="62" width="529"></p>
    <p>Note that the above equation represents the difference two scalars, the 
      square of the length of material vectors in the reference and deformed configuration. 
      If we expand this equation we can see this more clearly:</p>
    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq18.gif" height="192" width="621"></p>
    <p>Note that E, which will be defined as the large deformation or finite strain 
      tensor, has 9 components in 3D making it a 2nd order tensor. Two thirds 
      of the strain equation above is written in terms of dx'. Therefore, to define 
      Eij we will need to write the square of the length of the material vector 
      in the deformed configuration also in terms of the reference configuration 
      vector dx'. One way we can do this is to use the <a href="#defgrad">deformation 
      gradient tensor</a>, which gives the material vector dx in the deformed 
      configuration in terms of the material vector dx' in the reference configuration. 
      We also need to write the relationship using the deformation gradient tensor 
      such that we obtain pre and post multiplication by dx'i and dx'j, respectively. 
      First, since the quantity dxidxi is a scalar with repeated or dummy indices, 
      it doesn't matter if we write the repeated index with i,j,k, or any other 
      letter, it will produce the same result. So, let us write the dot product 
      with a k:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq19.gif" height="34" width="189"></p>
    <p>Next, we can write the deformed configuration material vector in terms 
      of the deformation gradient tensor and the reference configuration material 
      vectors as:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq20.gif" height="46" width="152"></p>
    <p>This gives us the dx'j post multiplication term. Note that if we change 
      the order of F and dx', this will not change the result. Also, since j is 
      a repeated or dummy index in the above equation, we can replace it with 
      any other repeated index, including i. If we carry out these operations, 
      we obtain:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq21.gif" height="42" width="149"></p>
    <p>Just to show that the Fkjdx'j and the dx'iFki give equivalent expressions, 
      we will expand each expression. For <img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq21.gif" align="absmiddle" height="42" width="149"></p>
    <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq22.gif" height="274" width="648"></p>
    <p>For <img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq21.gif" align="absmiddle" height="42" width="149"> 
      we have:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq23.gif" height="270" width="644"></p>
    <p>we can see that the two above equations are equivalent. We can now substitute 
      the expressions with the deformation gradient into the strain equation to 
      obtain:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq24.gif" height="46" width="412"> 
    </p>
    <p>The last task in defining Eij is to somehow rewrite the dx'idx'i term as 
      a dx'idx'j term. To do this, we can simply apply the Kronecker delta as:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq25.gif" height="46" width="140"></p>
    <p>We can expand the above relationship as:</p>
    <p><img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq26.gif" height="141" width="716"></p>
    <p>which shows that multiplying by the kronecker delta gives us back the original 
      quantity. We can now substitute in for the kronecker delta term into the 
      large strain equation to give:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq27.gif" height="46" width="444"></p>
    <p>We note that the above relationship can be separated in terms of dx'i as:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq28.gif" height="49" width="356"></p>
    <p>since both dx'i and dx'j are non-zero and arbitrary, then the quantity 
      in the bracket must be zero. This gives:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq29.gif" height="85" width="284"></p>
    <p>We divide by two to come up with our final definition of the finite strain 
      tensor in terms of the deformation gradient tensor as:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq30.gif" height="65" width="244"><a name="finitestraindeformgrad"></a></p>
    <p>We will expand the above expression for one normal and one shear stress. 
      First, consider the normal stress E11. In this case, i and j are fixed at 
      1. However, k in the above is a repeated or dummy index, and therefore terms 
      must be summed over k. Thus, we can write:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq30a.gif" height="214" width="444">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We also show an example of the shear strain E12:</p>
    <p><img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq30b.gif" height="214" width="452"></p>
    <p>In addition to the finite strain tensor, other deformation tensors are 
      oftern defined in terms of the deformation gradient tensor. An often used 
      deformation measure, especially in hyperelastic constitutive tensors used 
      to characterize soft tissues, is the <i>right Cauchy deformation tensor</i>. 
      This is defined as:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq31.gif" height="38" width="142"><a name="rightcauchy"></a></p>
    <p>The right Cauchy deformation tensor can also be defined in matrix form 
      as:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq32.gif" height="41" width="116"></p>
    <p>We can expand both the index and matrix notation of the right Cauchy deformation 
      tensor as:</p>
    <p><img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq33.gif" height="845" width="936">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>By closely examining the explicit expression for C, we can see that C is 
      symmeric, that is Cij = Cji.<a name="rightcauchsymmetric"></a></p>
    <p>In addition to the right Cauchy deformation tensor, we can define the left 
      Caucy deformation tensor in both index and matrix form as:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq34.gif" height="86" width="146"><a name="leftcauchy"></a></p>
    <p>We can similarly expand the left Cauchy deformation tensor as:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq35.gif" height="416" width="485"></p>
    <p>From the right and left Cauchy deformation tensors, we can further define 
      relationships between these tensors and the stretch tensors. First, consider 
      the definition of the right Cauchy:</p>
    <p><img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq56.gif" height="38" width="132"></p>
    <p>We next subtitute the polar decomposition of F for each F in the above 
      equation:</p>
    <p><img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq57.gif" height="85" width="341"> </p>
    <p>However, we know that since R is an orthogonal tensor, we have the following 
      relationship:</p>
    <p><img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq58.gif" height="81" width="296"> </p>
    <p>This result shows that the right Cauchy deformation tensor is equal to 
      the square of the right stretch tensor. Likewise, we can show that the left 
      Cauchy Deformation tensor is:</p>
    <p><img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq59.gif" height="177" width="308"></p>
    <p>Thus giving that the left Cauchy Deformation tensor is the square of the 
      left stretch tensor.</p>
    <p>We can furthermore find the eigenvalues of both U and V. The eigenvalues 
      of U are called the <i>principal stretches</i>. These are used to construct 
      some constitutive equations.</p>
    <p><b>V. Definition of the Finite Strain Tensor in terms of displacement gradient, 
      comparison to the small strain tensor</b></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the final part of this section, 
      we will derive the finite strain tensor in terms of the displacement gradient, 
      just as the small strain tensor was defined in terms of the displacement 
      gradient. We will then be able to compare the small strain and finite strain 
      tensor. To begin, recall that we can write the deformation gradient tensor 
      in terms of the displacement gradient as:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq13.gif" height="92" width="333"></p>
    <p>We can also write the finite strain tensor in terms of the deformation 
      gradient tensor as:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq30.gif" height="65" width="244"><a name="finitestraindefgrad2"></a></p>
    <p>Now let us write each deformation gradient tensor in terms of the deformation 
      gradient tensor with the indices Fki and Fkj:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq36.gif" height="160" width="170"></p>
    <p>If we substitute these <a href="#finitestraindefgrad2">expressions into 
      the finite strain tensor written in terms of the deformation gradient</a>, 
      we obtain:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq37.gif" height="94" width="440"></p>
    <p>Expanding the above strain expression, we have:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq38.gif" height="90" width="582"></p>
    <p>Now let's look at each term of this expression, starting with the term 
      with kronecker delta's multiplied together. We can expand this as:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq40.gif" height="416" width="664"></p>
    <p>Looking at the expansion, we see that the product of the kroneckor deltas 
      itself leaves a kronecker delta. In fact, when a quantity is multiplied 
      by a Kronecker delta, we actually exchange the non-repeated index:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq41.gif" height="38" width="130"></p>
    <p>Substituting this kronecker delta into the strain expression give:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq42.gif" height="90" width="544"></p>
    <p>Leaving us with:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq43.gif" height="90" width="442"></p>
    <p>Next, we turn our attention to the term <img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq44.gif" align="absmiddle" height="78" width="89">. 
      &nbsp;&nbsp;Again, we can expand this for i and j, summing over k:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq45.gif" height="806" width="712">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Here we note that the resulting displacement gradient indices match those 
      of i and j. Thus, we see again that the result of operating on a quantity 
      with the kronecker delta allows us to replace the summed or repeated index 
      of the product with the remaining free independent index of the kronecker 
      delta:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq46.gif" height="78" width="160">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We can clearly do the same index swapping with the other displacement term 
      that is multiplied with a kronecker delta:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq47.gif" height="82" width="160"></p>
    <p>If we substitute these results into the strain tensor, we obtain the finite 
      strain tensor in terms of displacement gradients:</p>
    <p><img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq48.gif" height="100" width="354"></p>
    <p>Now, recalling the small strain tensor we have:</p>
    <p><img src="bme456straindef_files/straineq49.gif" height="90" width="232"></p>
    <p>We note two major differences between the small and finite strain tensor. 
      First, the finite strain tensor contains a quadratic product of the displacement 
      gradient. This makes the finite strain tensor nonlinear. <i>Also, note that 
      unlike the small strain tensor, we did not make any assumptions about the 
      size of deformation for the large strain tensor. Thus, the large strain 
      tensor is exact for any deformation state. </i>The small strain tensor does 
      not contain the quadratic terms, and is therefore a <i>linearized</i> version 
      of the small strain tensor. Another subtle but critical point to note is 
      that the finite strain tensor displacement gradients are taken with respect 
      to the reference coordinates x'. The small strain tensor displacement gradients 
      are taken with respect to the deformed coodinates x. This is a critical 
      difference, especially when we consider that stress and strain tensors must 
      be matched to produce a correct expression for energy. Since both the Cauchy 
      stress tensor and the small strain tensor are defined in the deformed coordinate 
      system, they are energetically conjugate. However, for the finite strain 
      tensor, since it is defined in the reference coordinate system, we need 
      to derive a new stress tensor. Also, defining new stress tensors is also 
      important when we look at materials or tissues that undergo large deformation, 
      since these problems are inherently nonlinear. Therefore, for these problems 
      we need to write not only new stress tensors, but a new stress equilibrium 
      equation. We take these issues up in the next section. Finally, as we mentioned, 
      we have developed 9 new equations, but 12 new unkowns. </p>
    <table border="1" width="96%">
      <tbody><tr> 
        <td width="21%">Equations Type</td>

    </tbody></table>
    <p>Thus, even though we have considered both stress balance and kinematics 
      (displacements and strains), we still do not have a determinate system. 
      We need to relate stress and strain to close the loop and make the systems 
      determinate. This is where the nature of the material or tissue plays a 
      role, since this nature determines the relationship between stress and strain 
      we use, known as the constitutive relationship. </p>
