PPDEM, Polyarc-Parallel Discrete Element Model
PPDEM is a 2D discrete element code that uses polyarcs to approximate any 2D convex particle shapes.  It was written when I was in graduate school.  It has a full-fledge GUI and is capable of OpenMP parallel processing. The GUI was written in Visual Basic while the computational core was written in FORTRAN.
